I specifically said on the assignment requirements page that you need to
take the values from the command line.  I said this again several times
in class as well.

This means you only get 1/2 credit for the program, even when the values
produced are correct.  In addition, there is no convenient way for me to
redirect the output to the testresults.txt file, since I have to see the
prompts to know what to input and when.

In future, please try to follow the requirements.  If you have any questions
or wish to discuss, feel free to come see me during office hours or make an
appointment on my youcanbookme site.
